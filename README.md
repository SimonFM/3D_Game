# 3D_Game
A simple game written in opengl for a college assignment. The levels are created by reading in a .png file, where the white pixels indicate
where to draw a tile, the red pixels are an enemy, the blue pixels are the plyer and the black pixels represent the obstacles.

To move the player use the w a s d, to switch to the camera press caps lock. The mouse allows you to change where the camera is looking
at too.

The music was found on new grounds: http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/657490
All the textures were found online, i can't rememeber where, but they were.
